/**
 * File: stsh-job-list.h
 * ---------------------
 * Defines the STSHJobList class and documents its behavior.
 * If you want to add a new process to a job list, you might 
 * do so this way:
 * 
 *    static void addToJobList(STSHJobList& jobList, const vector<pair<pid_t, string>>& children) {
 *      STSHJob& job = jobList.addJob(kBackground); //
 *      for (const pair<string, pid_t>& child: children) {
 *        pid_t pid = child.first;
 *        const string& command = child.second;
 *        job.addProcess(STSHProcess(pid, command)); // third argument defaults to kRunning     
 *      }
 *    
 *      cout << jobList;
 *    }
 *    
 * As you detect state changes in individual processes, you can update process states like this:
 * 
 *    static void updateJobList(STSHJobList& jobList, pid_t pid, STSHProcess state) {
 *      if (!jobList.containsProcess(pid)) return;
 *      STSHJob& job = jobList.getJobWithProcess(pid);
 *      assert(job.containsProcess(pid));
 *      STSHProcess& process = job.getProcess(pid_t pid);
 *      process.setState(state);
 *      jobList.synchronize(job);
 *    }
