/**
 * File: simple-test3.cc
 * ---------------------
 * Presents the implementation of a short nonsense program that makes a small number of
 * system calls.  The program can be run standalone, but it's really designed to be fed as
 * an argument to the trace executable, as with:
 * 
 *    > ./trace ./simple-test3
 *
 * This test is useful for confirming that trace returns the same exit status as the process
 * it's tracing.
